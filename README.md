#simple_bank_system

This project is a simple text-based banking system implemented in Python. 
It allows users to perform basic banking operations such as deposit, withdrawal, 
and balance inquiry. The system reads account information from an input file, 
where each account is identified by a unique ID and a balance. Users can 
interact with the system by depositing money, withdrawing funds, and checking 
their balance. Input validation is implemented to ensure that all amounts are 
valid and positive. The system also allows changes to be saved back to the file, 
ensuring that accounts information is persistent
